This is a boilerplate for creating React applications using Vite. It includes a basic file structure, some commonly used dependencies, and configuration files for ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and Jest.

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, clone the repository to your local machine and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then, you can run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

This boilerplate comes with several pre-configured scripts:

- `dev`: Starts the development server
- `build`: Builds the production-ready app
- `test`: Runs Jest tests
- `serve`: Serves the built app
- `prepare`: Installs Husky (you shouldn't need to run this manually)
- `commit`: Creates a commit using Commitizen
- `format`: Formats code using Prettier
